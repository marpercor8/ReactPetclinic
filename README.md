# Petclinic Web Client with Updated React and Additional Features

This repository contains an updated version of the Petclinic web client with additional features implemented. Specifically, a new section for products and stocks has been added, which uses reactive technology and server sent events to provide real-time information about product availability and stock levels.

## Features
- **Reactive Products and Stocks:** The product and stock functionality implemented in this repository uses reactive technology to provide real-time information about product availability and stock levels. This means that any changes in the availability of a product will automatically be reflected in the user interface without the need to refresh the page.
- **Server Sent Events:** To implement the reactive product and stock functionality, server sent events technology has been used. This allows the server to send updates to the user interface in real-time, resulting in a more fluid and dynamic user experience.
- **Vite:** This repository also uses Vite as the development server and build tool. Vite is a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional bundlers, which allows for quicker development iterations and faster builds.

1. Clone the repository on your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies with the command `npm install`
3. Start the development server with the command `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application in action.
